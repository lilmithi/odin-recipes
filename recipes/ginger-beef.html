    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s a little extra effort to make this ginger beef versus my other
      favorite takeout dishes, but let me tell you that effort really goes the
      extra mile. Even so this ginger beef can still be on your dinner table in
      just 30 minutes! Crispy and tender beef tossed in that bold, sweet and
      spicy sauce? It&rsquo;s like nothing else! I&rsquo;ll be surprised if you
      end up with any leftovers.
